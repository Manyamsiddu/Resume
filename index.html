        <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
        <hr/>

        <h4>PREDICTING WILDFIRES WITH WEATHER FORECAST DATA USING ML</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>This wildfire prediction model can be used by government agencies, environment alorganizations, and disaster management teams to monitor and mitigate the risk of wildfires in forested regions.</li>
            <li>This project is about Predicting the wildfires in forest areas using satellites.Determinethe factors that encourage wildfires, may entail combining data from multiplesources, including ground sensors, satellite imaging and climate models.</li>
            <li>Tools Used: Keras, TensorFlow,python, Google Colab.</li>
            <li>To check accuracy the data is taken from Kaggle data sets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>LIFI BASED DATA TRASMISSION</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>High-speed, and interference-free data transmission leveraging visible light technology.</li>
            <li>Lifi based data transfer. That is data transfer using light. As we compare to the wifi or bluetooth transfer it is much faster and accurate. Data transfer will happen using LDR sensor which is used to observe the light variations. The reason to use this is As we compared other regular data transfers using light is much faster and accurate</li>
